title: "Media Multitasking and Bilingualism: Initial Analysis"
output: html_document
---

This Rmd file contains code for an initial analysis of the experiment "Media Multitasking and Bilingualism." All data were collected in Fall 2018 at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Contributors: Xinyang Miao, Jacob T. Fisher, Rene Weber

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(psych)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First, let's ingest the data. We have a list of csv files that contain the reaction time and accuracy data from the experiment, and we also have a large csv file that contains the survey data and post hoc memory task. We will ingest the files separately and then merge them later.

```{r}
files = list.files(path ="data/exp_data", pattern="*.csv", full.names = TRUE)
exp_data = do.call(plyr::rbind.fill, lapply(files, function(x) read.csv(x, as.is=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)))
surveydata = read.csv("data/surveydata.csv")
```

## TODO

- Create MMI and cross language MMI variables (Jacob will do this)
- Create bilingualism variable
- Code questions for each audiobook as a % correct variable
- Code enjoyment and attention scales for each audiobook
- Note participants who failed compliance check (create a new variable that is 1 if they answered "yes" to either of the compliance check questions and 0 otherwise)
- Remove outliers from matching task (RTs that were either way too fast or way too slow)
- Get % accuracy and RT measures for matching task during each audiobook
- Merge surveydata and exp_data


```{r}

```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
